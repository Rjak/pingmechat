pingmechat
==========

Extremely lightweight Python chat server with Javascript client class and SMS join notifications.

This project is at a very early, but functional, stage of development. I
recommend waiting a week or so to allow it to mature before using.


STRUCTURE
=========
- client: Javascript library for communicating with the server.
- server: Python server.
